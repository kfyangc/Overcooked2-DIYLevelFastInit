BepInEx 5 plugin (net35) that patches
[OC2DIYLevel](https://github.com/gua248/Overcooked2-LevelEditor) 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 for Overcooked! 2.
Test version 1.7.0.8 keeps a complete lightweight level catalog while loading info resources
and building configurations only for the selected level. Async discovery, menu healing,
the progress indicator, and incremental hot reload remain supported.

## Source layout

- `FastInitPlugin.cs`: plugin identity, shared fields and lifecycle hooks.
- `Plugin/`: common initialization and progress rendering.
- `Catalog/`: metadata models, disk/scene caches, direct serialized metadata reading,
  discovery and incremental refresh.
- `Frontend/`: menu rebuilding, save-dialog hooks and confirmed save-choice state.
- `Networking/`: copied client load requests and the remote entry gate.
- `Resources/`: shared state/hook registration, info bundles, level preparation,
  configuration ownership, lifetime cleanup, Qichi and info dependency adapters.
- `Previews/`: preview requests, thumbnail warmup and the persistent thumbnail cache.
- `Diagnostics/`: material auditing.
- `Infrastructure/`: coroutine host, async request helpers and result boxes.
- `BundleCodecs/`: the attributed LZMA decoder, UnityFS repacker and LZ4 encoder.

`FastInitPlugin` and `OnDemandResources` use partial files to retain their existing
reflection and Harmony contracts. Keep their fields/initializers together, in their
original order, in `FastInitPlugin.cs` and `Resources/OnDemandResources.cs` respectively.
Do not move initializers between partial files or rely on source-file compilation order.
The 1.6.11 split preserves all 23 top-level types and 410 original members, apart from
the version constant and partial declarations. It adds no loading or save behaviour.

## Build / deploy / verify

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release                      # uses default GameDir from csproj
dotnet build -c Release -p:GameDir="C:\Path\To\Overcooked! 2"
Copy-Item -LiteralPath bin/Release/DIYLevelFastInit.dll -Destination "<GameDir>/BepInEx/plugins/DIYLevelFastInit.dll" -Force
```

- Default game directory: `D:\Games\Steam Games\steamapps\common\Overcooked! 2`.
  Output: `bin/Release/DIYLevelFastInit.dll`. Keep the csproj version and `PluginVersion`
  in sync. Rebuild only this hook; `../OC2DIYLevel_src/` is reference source.
- Back up the installed DLL outside the plugins scan tree before deployment. The game
  locks the loaded DLL: coordinate shutdown with the user, copy only after it exits,
  compare source/destination SHA-256 hashes, then tell the user it is ready to restart.
  A failed copy must never be reported as an installed fix.
- No committed automated test suite. Verify in the game and inspect
  `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` (also
  `BepInEx/plugins/OC2DIYLevel/logs/logs_info_*/BepInExDebugLog.log`). Native Unity messages
  may appear only in `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/Team17/Overcooked2/output_log.txt`.
- Useful FastInit log lines:
  - `common bundles: ...`, `level set [...] ready (... metadata only)`,
    `FastInit complete: ...`, `level set menu rebuilt: ...`.
  - `catalog cache hit: ...`, `lightweight scene directory: ... no recipe configs`.
  - `on-demand info loaded/released` (resident bundle count),
    `on-demand config ready/released`, `scene runtime objects released`.
- Check cold discovery, warm-cache startup, browsing/sorting/previews, save selection,
  level entry, repeated restarts, switching sets, return to the frontend, hot reload,
  and host/client multiplayer. Keep completed checks distinct from untested paths.
  Build or Harmony signature checks alone do not verify Unity resource lifetimes.
- Useful isolated checks: metadata round trips with Unicode and all four player counts;
  rejecting stale fingerprints, invalid versions, truncated files, oversized lengths,
  and trailing data; resolving API references against the installed runtime; generating
  Harmony wrappers from the installed target signatures. Unity native method bodies
  cannot be exercised in an ordinary standalone CLR process.
- Verify the UnityFS metadata reader against an independent parser on real bundles.
  In the installed `young_v0.3/s_zhuzi_2`, floor material pointers reference the CAB
  inside `test_level/info_test_level`; `info_young` alone does not cover scene dependencies.
  Keep this cross-set regression distinct from unrelated rendering reports.
- For memory measurements, record process private bytes and virtual address space as
  well as working set, together with the scene and transition state. A small working
  set alone does not establish low 32-bit address-space usage. Cache file size is not
  a measurement of runtime memory savings.
- The machine has no default NuGet source; `NuGet.config` pins nuget.org. Don't remove it.

## Architecture

- Harmony prefix on `DIYLevelAssetBundleManager.Initialize` skips the original:
  `RunCheapInit` synchronously prepares `common`, static fields and DLC data, while
  `FastInitHost` loads the remaining `common*` dependencies in the background.
  `IsInitialized` (= `commonBundle != null`) must become true synchronously because the
  original consumer patches check it. Initialization is idempotent.
- Discovery processes sets one at a time in directory order. `LoadInfoSet` first tries
  `LevelCatalogCache`. On a miss, `CatalogMetadataRequest` reads scalar fields directly
  from the serialized source on one managed worker. Only the main thread creates
  lightweight SOs, writes the normal cache and publishes entries. The worker never
  calls Unity/BepInEx or mutates the shared dependency graph cache. Cancel it on disposal
  and plugin shutdown; pause publication during DIY gameplay/transitions and recheck the
  source fingerprint before publication. `Loading.EnableDirectCatalogReader=false`
  disables this path. Unsupported/failed reads fall back to the original async native
  `LevelSetInfo` load, extraction, `Unload(false)` and safe unused-asset collection.
  Do not restore unbounded parallel prefetch or full-info retention.
- `SerializedCatalogReader` supports little-endian serialized v17 files with type trees
  in bounded independent LZ4/raw UnityFS blocks. It follows local set/level/player and
  MonoScript pointers only, validates actual LevelEditorStub script identities, retains
  field/list order and skips recipe, audio and screenshot references. Unknown layouts,
  absent fields/type trees, external scalar/script pointers and invalid extents fall back.
  Source reading holds at most one decoded block (8 MiB limit), bounded metadata and
  one scalar object buffer. `InfoBundleGraph.CatalogSource` uses a private container
  parse; never call the shared `Open`/`Required` cache from this worker. It does not open
  native bundles, require Qichi resource graphs or trigger per-set asset collection.
- Warm discovery checks an approximately 4 ms work budget between sets instead of
  yielding after every cache hit. A single set can exceed the budget. Preserve directory
  order and transition pauses. Recheck resident common bundles before each request,
  since other loaders can complete bundles while an earlier request is pending.
  `startup timing` separates preparation/common/catalog phases and catalog subphases;
  wall-time fields include native/frame waits and must not be double-counted. Cache
  miss reasons and thumbnail warmup timings distinguish source scans from cache reads.
- `SetMetadata`, `LevelMetadata`, and `PlayerMetadata` contain only strings, numbers,
  and arrays. `LevelCatalogCache` writes versioned binary `.catalog` files under
  `Paths.CachePath/DIYLevelFastInit/`, named by a SHA-256 hash of the normalized directory
  path. The current schema is 2, with magic `0x32434944`. Validate the directory, info
  filename, length and UTC modification ticks; enforce bounded lengths and reject
  trailing data. Writes use a temporary file and read it back before replacement.
  Read/write failures fall back to discovery, so the cache remains disposable.
- Harmony **postfix** on `DIYLevelEntryUI.AddUI`: re-syncs the menu button list
  (`HealLevelSetButtons`), because the original builds it only once (snapshot guard).
- The prefix on `DIYLevelAssetBundleManager.SetupSceneDirectoryData` returns
  `SceneDirectoryCache.GetDirectory()`: all levels, four variants, scene names and star
  boundaries, initially without heavy `LevelConfig` objects. The cached list snapshot
  is order-sensitive. Retired directories are collected at the next blanket clear.
  The 1.5.x full-directory warm build and blanket-clear suppression have been removed.
- `OnDemandResources.ServerLoadPrefix` queues single-player/host preparation and skips
  the immediate `LoadLevelServer` body. Yield before native work, drain active preview
  and warmup requests, pin `_preparingBundles` across async container/info loads, then
  build one player-count configuration per frame. Only set `_directoryBuild` around
  each synchronous factory call, never across a yield. Replay `LoadLevelServer` once
  through a narrowly scoped `_resumeServerLoad` guard after everything is ready.
  Ignore duplicate server requests while `_serverPreparing`; finally paths release
  preparation pins/progress and clear the pending scene on failure.
- `BoostEntryPriority` saves `Application.backgroundLoadingPriority` and temporarily
  sets `High` after active preview/discovery native requests drain. Its scope covers
  server resource preparation through target scene arrival; restore on target/frontend
  `sceneLoaded`, failed/disposed preparation and plugin `OnDestroy`. Restore only while
  the current value is still `High`, preserving a different value set by another loader.
  Do not boost ordinary thumbnail warmup, browsing or client callbacks. Keep the scope
  separate from `_serverPreparing`, which ends at the original scene-load handoff.
  Bundle and info-asset phase timers plus handoff-to-scene timing support comparisons;
  priority changes do not guarantee instant entry and may reduce loading-time frame rate.
- `ClientLoadGate` defers reliable remote DIY `LevelLoadByName` messages at
  `Mailbox.OnMessageReceived`, before any callback or OC2DIYLevel prefix runs. Snapshot
  all four message fields and the sender/sequence/reliability envelope: the game registry
  reuses mutable message instances. Do not retain a borrowed payload or merely return
  early from `LoadLevelClientPatch`. The latter remains synchronous for replay and direct
  callers, so the original handler always consumes complete session/level settings.
- `ClientLoadQueue` coalesces pending duplicates, keeps the newest target, and permits
  one scoped replay. A request belongs to the exact client mailbox, peer and connection;
  check identity and the remote-client role after native waits and before replay. Cancel
  on client reset/loss/kick, non-DIY scene messages, frontend arrival and plugin shutdown.
  Drain uncancellable native requests before clearing `_clientPreparingBundles`; pin them
  independently of server preparation. Restore a client latency pause on failed/cancelled
  preparation only while its connection still matches. Leave unrelated mailbox traffic,
  vanilla levels and host loopback on their original paths.
- Client message preparation and handed-off transition ownership are separate. Cancel
  immediately revokes state filtering, while native requests retain their resource pins
  until completion. Filtering after handoff belongs to the original mailbox/peer/connection
  and ends on target scene arrival; stale `_pendingScene` is not a connection identity.
- Observe official save requests before Team17 opens their dialogs: clear obsolete DIY
  confirmation/UI ownership and cancel old client/server entry permissions while keeping
  native drain pins. Remote save guards use current transition identity, not resource
  pending state, so a cancelled request cannot block a fresh save handshake.
- Server preparation has a generation and a captured network context. Recheck them after
  resource waits, between config factories and before handing off. Frontend arrival,
  connection reset/loss and shutdown invalidate the generation without releasing native
  request pins early. A cancelled online request must not resume as an offline load.
- `PrepareResources` shares async bundle/info preparation and per-frame configuration
  factories between server and gated client entry. Keep `_directoryBuild` scoped to each
  synchronous factory. A complex individual config or scene activation may still spike.
- On both server/single-player and remote DIY entry, stop the frontend client save
  countdown, clear pending DIY save payloads and hide only the save-wait overlay.
  Retain the save dialog from confirmation through scene arrival, locking input with
  owned Team17 event-system suppressors before the original callback can hide it.
  Wait for `CanHide()` without calling `Hide(false)` or `CleanUp`; keep the dialog and
  its save-slot Update running. Don't Save may skip only its own synchronous ForceClose;
  real disconnect/invite closes must still run. Release only owned suppressors on
  scene arrival, cancellation, failure, official selection and shutdown. Failed old
  requests must not restore or unlock a newer selection. Pass the held view directly
  to preparation owners before the first yield; never reacquire it from global state
  after waiting. Prevent countdown restart and
  stale `LoadedCampaignMapSave` sends during the transition. Announce only the message's
  start-loading state before native waits; suppress its duplicate during the scoped
  replay. Never announce `LoadedKitchen` early: the original scene readiness path owns it.
  State filtering for the queued request requires the current mailbox/peer/connection.
  For two minutes after a gated entry, log client state sends and disconnect call paths
  to distinguish load/state problems from session loss; these hooks do not alter errors.
- Save-dialog guards cover DLC 15 only: suppress same-frame selection reentry, an already
  visible dialog, dialog reopening during entry, and repeated `OnSaveGameReady` callbacks.
  Clear duplicate frontend save payloads when suppressing their show attempt, so Update
  does not retry them indefinitely. `SaveSelectionState` retains only the frontend
  identity once a choice finishes (including Don't Save), stopping its client countdown.
  Reuse a confirmed choice and repeat the real save-ready acknowledgement for a duplicate
  frontend request; never repeat it during level entry. New host selections, client
  lifecycle resets, target scene arrival and frontend arrival clear the retained choice.
  Cancellation before confirmation permits reselection. Log successful dialog opens /
  closes, outgoing save-ready state and the server's updated per-machine/slot states.
- Public `levelSetInfos` entries remain lightweight SOs with stable identities; full
  `LoadedSet.Info` objects stay private. The directory remains complete for save IDs,
  original dependency lookup, sorting and arcade selection. Never replace it with a
  selected-level-only list or populate its entries with full recipe/audio graphs.
- Resource ownership is split between reusable directory configurations (`Levels`,
  keyed by scene name) and objects created by each loaded scene instance (`SceneObjects`,
  keyed by `Scene`). SetupConfig, custom recipe/lookup factories and runtime prefab
  cloning are tracked. Scene-instance objects are destroyed on `sceneUnloaded`, including
  on same-level restarts. `isQuit:true` clears generated objects and directory references
  before allowing the original prefab clear to run; `isQuit:false` retains its original
  behavior. Track only objects created by these factories: SetupConfig clones the first
  round's recipe list, while other rounds may still reference shared assets.
- Info bundles stay loaded while a related scene is loaded, is the pending target, or
  is the current uncached preview set. `ReleaseUnused` clears catalog screenshot references and
  closes unneeded info bundles with `Unload(false)` after clearing full-info references.
  Do not force-destroy info assets with `Unload(true)`: other materials or scenes can
  still reference them. New and old resources may overlap during transitions.
  The optional `OC2StageThumbnailPreview.Patches.PreviewController.UpdatePreview(Image,
  LevelInfoSO)` adapter is installed in `Start`. Cached previews use private copied
  sprites; an uncached preview temporarily retains at most one source set.
- The thumbnail prefix must only queue a request and return; never call `Resolve`,
  synchronous `LoadSet`, `LoadFromFile`, or `LoadAsset` from the menu callback.
  `PreviewRoutine` coalesces focus changes into the latest image/level request and
  starts work after yielding a frame. `LoadPreview` uses async bundle and info requests,
  pins `_previewBundles` until every native request finishes, and only applies an image
  if its request is still current and the menu hierarchy is active. Stale requests are
  drained and released rather than cancelled or allowed to overwrite a newer image.
  Drain queued unused-asset collection before starting the next preview, so sustained
  browsing cannot accumulate detached asset graphs behind an always-busy worker.
  `PendingLevelInfos` shares the same native request for a selected asset;
  `PendingInfos` retains the separate full-set fallback request. Refresh
  cancels the preview selection and waits for its worker to drain before mutating sets.
- With the optional thumbnail adapter installed, `FinishLoading` queues sequential
  thumbnail prewarming over the complete catalog, without requiring menu visits.
  Pin `_warmBundles` while native requests run. Load selected LevelInfo assets, copy
  one image per frame, and release/wait for cleanup between direct levels. If full-set
  fallback is needed, reuse that graph for the remaining batch before releasing it.
  Pause for gameplay, transitions and uncached foreground previews. Refresh invalidates
  the warmup generation and waits for native requests to drain before changing entries.
  Cached foreground images bypass the warmup wait and cleanup queue.
  Preview waits for warmup, cleanup and discovery must check `PreviewIsCurrent` each
  frame. A new pending scene cancels that request; waiting unconditionally for cleanup
  would deadlock server preparation waiting for the preview worker to drain, because
  cleanup is deferred during transitions.
- `ThumbnailCache` persists versioned `.thumb` files containing a source stamp, bounded
  dimensions, a SHA-256 checksum and PNG data; empty payloads record absent screenshots.
  It fingerprints all info/common source files by path, length and UTC modification time.
  Invalidate the stamp on catalog completion/refresh; source changes conservatively
  invalidate all thumbnails. Header-only readiness checks avoid decoding during warmup;
  actual reads verify the full payload and fall back to async loading on corruption.
  GPU copies handle non-readable source textures and shrink to at most 640 x 360.
  Keep copied sprites private to the preview adapter: never assign them to public
  catalog SOs or scene-directory screenshots, which may outlive LRU eviction.
  Keep at most eight decoded images; clear them at level entry. The single disk writer
  has a four-item queue, atomic replacement and a 128 MiB oldest-entry eviction limit.
  Warmup observes writer backpressure. Workers never call Unity APIs off the main thread.
- `InfoBundleGraph` indexes serialized CAB names from info bundle directory tables,
  then reads only serialized metadata prefixes to find external CAB references in the
  selected scene and info files. Follow the transitive closure, including cycles.
  Do not assume a scene uses only its own set's info bundle, or rely solely on the
  info bundle's own dependency names: scene-only references can point to other sets.
  Sources are fingerprinted by path, length and UTC modification ticks; cached graph
  entries contain strings and block tables, never Unity assets or decompressed payloads.
- `InfoBundles` owns bundle containers; `LoadedSet.Required` pins each active/preview
  set's transitive dependencies. Dependency-only bundles do not load `LevelSetInfo`.
  `_catalogBundles` pins cold-discovery dependencies until extraction finishes.
  Shared dependencies are released only after every set and discovery pin is gone.
  `SceneDependencies` tracks scene-specific closures separately from the info closure;
  discard closures for departed scenes even when another scene in the same set remains.
  `PendingBundles` lets synchronous entry join the same native async request; never
  start a duplicate file load while that request is pending. Defer menu selection and
  thumbnail loading during a cold info request.
- `QichiResources` prepares `qichi_assets` before any `info_qichi` container is consumed,
  including cold discovery, source previews and both entry paths. Resolve the optional
  Qichi runtime v10 APIs by reflection, join its existing native request or reuse the
  resident bundle, then synchronize its request/loading/loaded fields and shared loader
  reference. Do not start a duplicate while a request is pending. Qichi owns this bundle;
  never add it to FastInit's info cleanup. File reading and decoding remain in Qichi's
  runtime. The adapter covers the known info filename, not arbitrary external packages.
  Log the runtime request startup separately: its synchronous file read/decode occurs
  before the Unity async request and must not be described as a non-blocking phase.
  Verify a fresh-process `s_qichi_1_5` entry and its dungeon meshes/materials separately
  from the cross-set `s_zhuzi_2` info dependency regression.
- The reader targets UnityFS v6 / serialized-file versions 9–21 used by this Unity
  2017 game, with bounded uncompressed, LZ4 and LZMA prefix decoding. LZMA decoder
  code is an adapted public-domain SDK subset in the same source file; retain
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and its attribution if changing it.
- Cleanup requests are coalesced by `RequestCleanup` / `CleanupRoutine`. After yielding
  a frame, wait until neither a transition nor DIY gameplay is active, then let
  `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()` reclaim unreferenced assets. Cold discovery waits
  for this cleanup before consuming the next source bundle. Also defer collection while
  a preview is loading and for 0.5 seconds after a focus change. Tracked bundle counts do
  not count detached assets awaiting collection.
- `AuditSceneMaterials` checks active renderers two frames after DIY scene entry. It
  logs material/shader names and support status, warning on empty mesh material slots,
  missing, unsupported, or
  internal-error shaders. This is diagnostic only; do not replace shaders or materials
  as a fallback without confirming the correct intended asset.
  Empty particle-renderer material slots can be intentional; do not report them as
  broken floor materials.
- Hot sync diffs `SetSnapshot`s, updates changed entries and restores directory order.
  It is blocked during DIY gameplay or transitions; `Syncing` blocks level selection
  during refresh. Sweep only DIY scene bundles through the original bundle manager.
  Do not force-unload vanilla dependencies or `common*`; their lifetime belongs to the
  original reference counts or other loaders.
- `FastInitHost.Guard` drives nested iterators and disposes them on failure, preserving
  cleanup/finally paths. Unity async requests cannot be cancelled: after 15 seconds,
  log and keep waiting for the same request. Only a completed failed request may fall
  back to synchronous loading; never race an unfinished request with a second load.
- Private statics of the target plugin are set via reflection (`AccessTools.Field`):
  `commonBundle`, `diyLevelCover`, `diyLevelGameSessionPrefab`, `configTemplateSO`,
  `Instance`, `levelSetSelectionMenu`, and method `AddLevelSetButton`. These names are the
  contract with the compiled OC2DIYLevel 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 — if that plugin updates, re-verify against
  its decompiled source at `C:\Users\yang\.cache\OC2DIYLevel-decompiled\OC2DIYLevel_src\`.

## Selected level assets

- `InstallRecipeHooks` detects the optional-recipe factory in the target assembly.
  OC2DIYLevel 0.10 uses `RecipeHelper.GetOrderDefinitionNodeCustomRecipeOptional`;
  0.11 uses `CustomRecipeOptionalRegister.GetOrderDefinitionNode`, resolved by reflection
  to keep the DLL loadable with 0.10. Both paths retain the common custom-recipe hook,
  both lookup hooks and prefab tracking. Ownership sets deduplicate shared results.
  Missing required targets must still fail installation rather than silently lose tracking.

- `LoadedSet.Info` is optional and holds only the full-set compatibility fallback;
  `LoadedLevels` stores selected native LevelInfo assets by scene. Public catalog SOs
  remain lightweight and stable. Cold scalar-catalog discovery uses the direct metadata
  reader when supported; only its compatibility fallback reads the full info graph.
- Resolve metadata SO names through `LevelAssetIndex` with unique case-insensitive
  basenames. Validate loaded type/name/scene; unknown, ambiguous and failed addresses
  fall back only after native completion and while that consumer is still current.
- `PendingLevelInfos` uses set-path plus asset-address keys, separate from full-set
  `PendingInfos`. Synchronous consumers must join a pending native asset request and
  must never issue a competing request/fallback while it remains incomplete.
- `ReleaseUnused` drops per-level references for departed scenes and retains the exact
  uncached preview scene. Keep container/CAB dependencies and cache-file leases until
  their last active, pending, preview or warmup owner has finished.

## Startup info bundle optimization

- The owner authorized replacing `info*` files in 1.6.18. `InfoBundleOptimizer`
  converts supported single-block LZMA inputs and atomically replaces their original
  paths only after `ValidateConverted` checks output/source file hashes, complete
  decoded-data hash, block bounds and equivalent versions/CAB/node metadata.
- Generated independent blocks use flags `0x02`/`0x00`, never the source's Streamed
  bit `0x40`; the installed Unity's LZ4 stream callbacks fail. A generic parser or
  successful managed conversion does not establish full native Unity acceptance.
- `InfoBundleOptimizationBatch` owns one cancellable managed worker. Its callbacks
  only enqueue diagnostics; main-thread Update drains them. Set `InfoFilesPreparing`
  before cheap initialization and retain it until the worker has fully exited, including
  coroutine disposal. Never call Unity or BepInEx from the worker.
- Complete this startup phase before any info graph/catalog/preview/native request.
  Keep synchronous `common` initialization and IsInitialized timing unchanged. Do not
  replace files during hot refresh. Early remote DIY messages may use a basename-only
  file lookup while the catalog is empty, but must retain copied payloads, acknowledge
  start and wait for startup/catalog completion before BeginClientPreparation. Setting
  `_pendingScene` early would deadlock discovery's transition wait.
- Every set's `.diylevel-fastinit` child directory holds the cross-process lock,
  GUID temporary files and unique `original-<GUID>.bundle` / `.record` pairs. Never put
  backup/temp files matching `info*` at the set root. Never overwrite an existing backup.
  Record basenames only with bounded lengths; validate record extents and hashes.
- Use the installed Mono's supported atomic File.Replace with a unique backup. There
  is no truncate/copy-over-source fallback. Recheck source identity/hash under an
  exclusive handle before commit; verify the captured backup and new source afterward.
  Commit and rollback are non-cancellable critical sections retaining both versions.
  Unsupported, locked and failed inputs retain usable originals; clean only owned temps.
- Restore mode takes precedence over optimization, only replaces a source matching the
  recorded optimized hash, validates the original backup, and preserves the displaced
  optimized copy. Never restore over a later map update or corrupt recovery record.
- Existing independent LZ4/raw layouts skip conversion after bounded structural checks.
  Do not rewrite their timestamps each startup. File-length/mtime fingerprints must
  invalidate catalog, graph and thumbnail data naturally when replacement occurs.
- `BundleFileCache` remains legacy managed code for historical compatibility checks;
  production no longer Configure/Queue/Acquire/Tick it or select its physical paths.
  Old bundle-cache options are ignored. Scalar catalog/thumbnail caches are separate.
- `UnityFsRepacker` streams 128 KiB output blocks with bounded buffers and the original
  LZMA dictionary. Never retain the entire resource payload or clamp its dictionary.

## Constraints

- Target framework net35 / C# 7.3: no ValueTuples, no `yield` inside try/catch.
- `levelSetInfos` order must remain directory order — the arcade mod maps level-set
  selection by list position.
- Plugin dir must be resolved from `typeof(DIYLevelAssetBundleManager).Assembly.Location`,
  never `GetExecutingAssembly()` (would point at this plugin's own directory).
- Keep `common*` bundles loaded before consuming `info_*` bundles (dependency resolution).
- Container loading includes one info bundle plus transitive dependencies of the
  selected scene/set. Object loading requests a unique selected LevelInfo asset when
  available, otherwise the full LevelSetInfo fallback. Do not equate this with splitting
  the bundle file or removing selected-level dependencies. Common bundles and other
  mods' retained assets remain outside this plugin's cleanup scope.

## Code style

- Comments in English, minimal: one class-level `<summary>` plus single-line `//` notes
  only where the code can't speak. Keep the existing style across the partial files.
- Chinese only in functional UI/localization strings. If any non-ASCII source is added,
  keep the UTF-8 BOM (csc otherwise reads the file as the system codepage).

## Build gotchas

- This installed Mono's `FileStream` and `MonoIO` can throw
  `System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException` for missing files/paths. It derives
  directly from `Exception`, not `IOException`. Cache miss/race handling must cover it;
  do not rely only on desktop CLR file exceptions. Verify empty-cache creation against
  the actual game runtime, and keep simulator results distinct from native execution.
  The bundled corlib also lacks the public six-argument `FileStream(..., FileOptions)`
  overload. Use the supported five-argument buffered constructor; compile managed-only
  cache/codec probes against the actual game corlib as an additional API check.

- The `UnityEngine.dll` facade alone is not enough: module references
  (CoreModule, AssetBundleModule, ImageConversionModule, IMGUIModule, TextRenderingModule,
  UnityEngine.UI) are required. ImageConversionModule provides PNG encode/decode.
- The game has a global-namespace `UIUtils` that shadows `OC2DIYLevel.UIUtils` — fully
  qualify the latter.
- `[BepInDependency]` with the two-argument enum fails to resolve; use the single-argument
  form (defaults to hard dependency).
- Prefer `IOException` to `InvalidDataException`: the latter compiled successfully but
  produced `TypeLoadException` in the installed game's Mono runtime.
- Do not use `JsonUtility` for nested catalog metadata: the installed Unity serializer
  omitted the level arrays, including after making their types public. Keep the binary
  format and round-trip validation; no JSONSerializeModule reference is needed here.
- This game's `Scene` API has no public `handle` property. Use the `Scene` struct as
  the scene-instance dictionary key.

## Publishing rule

Commit each version independently after implementation and relevant checks, before
starting the next version. Do not include version numbers in commit subjects or bodies;
describe the concrete change instead. Keep `PluginVersion` and the csproj version
synchronized, and put version identifiers in plugin metadata, tags and release titles.
When rewording local history, leave commits already in `origin/master` unchanged.

For approved GitHub release creation and asset uploads, use the token from this
repository's local `.env` file. Load it into the publishing process environment without
printing it, putting it in command arguments or committing `.env`. Do not substitute
cached credentials from another account.

Creating the GitHub repo, pushing, or cutting releases requires the owner's explicit
review and approval first — never push on your own initiative.
